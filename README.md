# In-Silico Identification and Functional Characterization of Helicobacter pylori Gene

## Project Overview
This project focuses on the in-silico identification and functional characterization of a target gene/protein from *Helicobacter pylori* using sequence analysis and homology-based annotation. Computational tools were used to analyze gene sequence properties and predict biological function.

## Objectives
- To identify the target gene/protein sequence
- To perform sequence analysis
- To predict the function using homology-based annotation
- To understand the biological role of the gene/protein

## Tools and Resources Used
- Python
- Biopython
- NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information)
- BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool)

## Methodology
1. Retrieval of gene/protein sequence from database
2. Sequence analysis using Biopython
3. Homology search using BLAST
4. Functional annotation based on similarity

## Outcome
The study provides functional insight into the selected *Helicobacter pylori* gene/protein using computational biology approaches.
